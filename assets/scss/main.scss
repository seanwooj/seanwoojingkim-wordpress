One file to rule them all,
One file to find them,
One file to bring them all,
And in the darkness merge them.

This is an in progress refactorization of the current state of SCSS chaos which reigns in our app.
It seeks to unify all of our stylesheets into a cohesive, heirarchal, and easy to understand pattern.

Using a Scaleable and Modular Architecture for CSS pattern (https://smacss.com/), henceforth referred to as SMACSS
and elements from an excellent sitepoint article (http://www.sitepoint.com/architecture-sass-project/),
we aim to organize our site's CSS in the following pattern:

*/

@import 'base/_variables'; // loading this first in base because the variables should trickle down before other things in base
@import 'layout/_skeleton.scss';
@import 'layout/_header.scss';
